# Discord, but a little bit Less Garbage

Discord is kinda garbage.  This userscript makes it a little less garbage by:

* Replacing fuzzy timestamps with exact timestamps where possible
* Removing the following nags:
  * Desktop version installation reminder
  * Ctrl + K quick switch tutorial
  * Inbox tutorial
* Resizing the inbox floating window

It's just a bit Less Garbage.
